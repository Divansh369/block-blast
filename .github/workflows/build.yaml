    # In a project with dependencies, you would have steps here like:
    # - name: Install dependencies
    #   run: npm install
    # - name: Run tests
    #   run: npm test
    # - name: Build project
    #   run: npm run build

    # Since this project is a static site with no build step, our "build"
    # is to archive the necessary files for deployment.
